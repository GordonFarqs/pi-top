# [pi-top](https://pi-top.com) - Frontend technical test

I have kept the implementation as simple as possible, with `time` constraints in mind.

This does mean I implemented the todo list using a ModalView. In a real world application this would not be recommended.

In a real world application I would have implemented the differnt pages, list / create / view, as seperate routes, using React Router.

My feelings here were I would rather implement Redux state management with the available time. Again in an application this size it is total overkill.

However I thought you would get a better view of my coding ability / style implementing something like redux rather than router.

I apologise beforehand if my css modules code is a little beginnerish. I have never worked with them before but felt this would be a great oppurtunity to try them out.
